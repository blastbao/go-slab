# Who is this for

This library may be interesting to you if you wish to reduce garbage
collection (e.g. stop-the-world GC) performance issues in your golang
programs, allowing you to switch to explicit byte array memory
management techniques.

This can be useful, for example, for long-running server programs that
manage lots of in-memory data items, such as caches and databases.

# Example usage

    arena := NewArena(48,         // The smallest slab class "chunk size" is 48 bytes.
                      1024*1024,  // Each slab will be 1MB in size.
                      2,          // Power of 2 growth in "chunk sizes".
                      nil)        // Use default make([]byte) for slab memory.

    var buf []byte

    buf = arena.Alloc(64)         // Allocate 64 bytes.
      ... use the buf ...
    arena.DecRef(buf)             // Release our ref-count when we're done with buf.

    buf = arena.Alloc(1024)       // Allocate another 1K byte array.
      ... use the buf ...
    arena.AddRef(buf)             // The buf's ref-count now goes to 2.
      ... use the buf some more ...
    arena.DecRef(buf)
      ... still can use the buf since we still have 1 ref-count ...
    arena.DecRef(buf)             // We shouldn't use the buf after this last DecRef(),
                                  // as the library might recycle it for a future Alloc().

# Design concepts

The byte arrays ([]byte) that are allocated by this library are
reference-counted.  When a byte array's reference count drops to 0, it
will be placed onto a free-list for later re-use.  This can reduce the
need to ask the go runtime to allocate new memory and perhaps delay
the need for a full stop-the-world GC.

The AddRef()/DecRef() functions use slice/capacity math instead of
"large" additional tracking data structures (e.g., no extra
hashtables) in order to reach the right ref-counter metadata.

This implementation also does not use any of go's "unsafe"
capabilities, allowing it to remain relatively simple.

Memory is managed via a simple slab allocator algorithm.  See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation

Each arena tracks one or more slabClass structs.  Each slabClass
manages a different "chunk size", where chunk sizes are computed using
a simple "growth factor" (e.g., the "power of 2 growth" in the above
example).  Each slabClass also tracks zero or more slabs, where every
slab tracked by a slabClass will all have the same chunk size.  A slab
manages a (usually large) continguous array of memory bytes (1MB from
the above example), and the slab's memory is subdivided into many
fixed-sized chunks of the same chunk size.  All the chunks in a new
slab are placed on a free-list that's part of the slabClass.

When Alloc() is invoked, the first "large enough" slabClass is found,
and a chunk from the free-list is taken to service the allocation.  If
there are no more free chunks available in a slabClass, then a new
slab (e.g., 1MB) is allocated, chunk'ified, and the request is
processed as before.

# Concurrency

The Arena returned from NewArena() is not concurrency safe.
Please use your own locking.

# Chainability

The []byte buf's can be chained via the SetNext()/GetNext() functions.
This may be useful for developers wishing to reduce fragmentation when
they have wildly varying byte array sizes.

For example, a server cache may need to manage many items whose sizes
range from small to large (16 bytes to 1MB).  Instead of invoking
Arena.Alloc() on the exact item size, the developer may wish to
consider slicing an item into many more smaller 4KB byte arrays.

For a 1MB item, for example, the application can instead invoke
Arena.Alloc(4096) for 256 times and use the Arena.SetNext() function
to chain those smaller 4KB buffers together.  By slicing memory into
uniform-sized, smaller-sized buffers, there may be less fragmentation
and better overall re-use of slabs.  Additionally, the last []byte
buffer in the chain may be smaller than 4KB to not waste space.

# Application specific slab memory allocator

The NewArena() function takes an optional malloc() callback function,
which will be invoked whenever the arena needs more memory for a new
slab.  If the supplied malloc() func is nil, the arena will default to
instead using make([]byte, sizeNeeded).

An application-specific own malloc() function can be useful for
tracking and/or limiting the amount of slab memory that an Arena uses.
It can be also used by advanced applications to supply mmap()'ed
memory to an arena.

# Rules

* You need to invoke AddRef()/DecRef() with the exact same buf
  that you received from Alloc(), from the same arena.
* Don't call Alloc() with a size greater than the arena's slab size.
  e.g., if your slab size is 1MB, then Alloc(1024 * 1024 + 1) will fail.
* Careful with your ref-counting -- that's the fundamental tradeoff
  with now trying to avoid GC.
* Do not grow or append() on the slices returned by Alloc().
* Do not use cap() on slices returned by Alloc(), as that has
  information / abstraction "leakage" and should not be depended on.

# Testing

Unit test code coverage, as of 0.0.0-0-gecfea2f, is 100%.

# TODO

* Currently, slabs that are allocated are never freed.
* Memory for one slabClass is never reassigned to another slabClass.
  Memory reassignment might be useful whenever data sizes of items in
  long-running systems change over time.  For example, sessions in an
  online game may initially fit fine into a 1K slab class, but start
  getting larger than 1K as players acquire more inventory.
  Meanwhile, most of the slab memory is "stuck" in the 1K slab class
  when it's now needed in the 2K slab class.  The chainability features
  of go-slab, of note, should also be considered in these cases.
